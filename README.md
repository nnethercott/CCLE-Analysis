## Description
Here the results of a statistical analysis of breast cancer data are presented. Relevant datasets for the project can be found through the [Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)](https://depmap.org/portal/download/) database. 

The CCLE is a multi-institutional effort to develop a comprehensive database for varying types of cancer. 

All relevant statistical undertakings in this project are categorized under different project folders with respect to their scope and or data. 


<a name="motivation"/>

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to understand the link between the genetic and physiological data of a patient and how efficiently cancer-treating drugs perform on their cells.  Unsupervised methods such as hierarchical or k-means clustering may allow for an undestanding of hidden structure in the data, and regression analysis could help us quantitatively predict how well a drug will perform on an individual given their gene sequencing data. 

To simplify the project scope, the analysis is strictly limited to patients having breast cancer, as opposed to all cancers which were present in the main dataset. 

<a name="requirements"/>

## Requirements 
The project itself uses the following files from the CCLE database:
- *data_clinical_patient.txt*
- *data_clinical_sample.txt*
- *data_drug_treatment_auc.txt*
- *data_mrna_seq_rpkm.txt*
For seamless integration with the existing code, download and save these files in a directory denoted `Dataset` stored in the root. 

On the R side, loading the project in R Studio should prompt to load any missing packages you have.  For the Python dependent code (used mainly for exploratory purposes) simply pip install from `requirements.txt` as such:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
A collection of utilities and preprocessing scripts are included in the utilities folder of the project.

## Results 
### Hierarchical Classification

</p>

One vein of analysis was to consider the clusters arising from applying heirarchical clustering (euclidean distance, single linkage) to a reduced dataset containing only two cancers which in theory should be quite different in their manifestation.  We prove the merit of this approach using samples corresponding to breast and central nervous system cancers. 

4 classifiers were trained by changing 2 parameters; sparsity of the drug data, and projection of data along first *n* principle components which accounted for 90% of the variance. In the most refined case (PC projection and reduced drug data) the labels generated by the unsupervised model agreed with the real labels with an accuracy of 74%.
